			<h2>Sociologist, Author, Essayist, Quisitive Queer</h2>

				<p>Cory Albertson is an interdisciplinary scholar whose research spans media cultures, gender and sexuality studies and social justice movements (in Contexts [2014 and 2016], Feminist Approaches to Media Theory and Research [forthcoming, 2018], and Youth and Sexualities: Public Feelings and Contemporary Cultural Politics [forthcoming, 2018]). His new book, <i>A Perfect Union? Television and the Winning of Same-Sex Marriage</i> (Routledge, 2018), examines network television’s representations of LGBQ relationships and their impact in shifting public attitudes in favor of same-sex marriage. He engages with such subjects beyond academia to mainstream outlets as well. His work as a public scholar, essayist, and journalist has appeared in publications such as The Huffington Post, Interview, Out, Paste and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Albertson is the recipient of the 2014 Jacqueline Boles Excellence in Teaching Fellowship as well as the 2014 Georgia State University Certificate for Excellence in College Teaching.</p>
